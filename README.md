# Binary Clock

This is a simple Raspberry Pi hat for building a Binary Clock.

## Hardware

See the `hw` directory for schematics.

## Notes for exporting from EasyEDA

EasyEDA lets you store projects on their website, but it's nice to track copies
here as well.

1. Right click on the `binary_clock2` project in the project side bar. Click
   "Manage Project->Download".
2. Unzip the downloaded file and copy the `.json` files to the `hw` directory.
3. Export the schematic as a PDF and copy to the `hw` directory.
